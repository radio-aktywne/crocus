        This endpoint invalidates authentication sessions. After revoking the

        has to re-authenticate at the Ory OAuth2 Provider. This endpoint does
        not invalidate any tokens.


        If you send the subject in a query param, all authentication sessions
        that belong to that subject are revoked.

        No OpenID Connect Front- or Back-channel logout is performed in this
        case.


        Alternatively, you can send a SessionID via `sid` query param, in which
        case, only the session that is connected

        to that SessionID is revoked. OpenID Connect Back-channel logout is
        performed in this case.


        When using Ory for the identity provider, the login provider will also
        invalidate the session cookie.

          description: >-
            ForceSubjectIdentifier forces the "pairwise" user ID of the end-user
            that authenticated. The "pairwise" user ID refers to the

            (Pairwise Identifier
            Algorithm)[http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#PairwiseAlg]
            of the OpenID

            Connect specification. It allows you to set an obfuscated subject
            ("user") identifier that is unique to the client.


            Please note that this changes the user ID on endpoint /userinfo and
            sub claim of the ID Token. It does not change the

            sub claim in the OAuth 2.0 Introspection.


            Per default, ORY Hydra handles this value with its own algorithm. In
            case you want to set this yourself

            you can use this field. Please note that setting this field has no
            effect if `pairwise` is not configured in

            ORY Hydra or the OAuth 2.0 Client does not expect a pairwise
            identifier (set via `subject_type` key in the client's

            configuration).


            Please also be aware that ORY Hydra is unable to properly compute
            this value during authentication. This implies

            that you have to compute this value on every authentication process
            (probably depending on the client ID or some

            other unique value).


            If you fail to compute the proper value, then authentication
            processes which have id_token_hint set might fail.

            interface.
